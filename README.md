As part of breaking up the responsibility for the Cacti plugin vs other components, I am experimenting with
using Composer to pull in the core of Weathermap as a dependency for other components. This would be done
at the packaging stage, so it makes no difference to an end user. I just wanted to see if it works, conveniently.
